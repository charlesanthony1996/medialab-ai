# Racism
## Generally
Definition: “The term "racial discrimination" shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.”
## Anti-muslim racism
Definition: “Islamophobia is any distinction, exclusion, or restriction towards, or preference against, Muslims (or those perceived to be Muslims) that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.”
## Anti-black racism
Definition: “specific kind of racial prejudice directed towards Black people, or those perceived to be Black. More than merely a product of a few bad actors or individual prejudice, antiBlack racism is systematic and structural. It systematically marginalizes Black people and communities, and devalues Blackness in all contexts”
## Anti-asian racism
Definition: “Anti-Asian racism refers to prejudices and racist narratives against people who are considered to be of Asian origin. It usually involves references to South, Southeast and East Asian countries. The prejudices against Asian people go in different directions: On the one hand, they are stigmatized as "different", "dangerous" or "homogeneous" and, for example - as in the corona pandemic or the SARS pandemic in 2002/2003 - blamed for the spread of diseases. Other narratives speak of "hard-working model migrants". They are therefore often denied that they experience racism.“


# Antisemitism
## Generally
Definition: Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.
-	Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.
-	Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.
-	Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.
-	Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).
-	Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.
-	Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.
-	Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.
-	Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.
-	Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.
-	Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.
-	Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.
## Structural anti-Semitism 
Definition: does not openly agitate against "the Jews", but uses codes such as "high finance" or "the East Coast" and engages in an abbreviated, personalized and moralizing criticism of economic and power relations. In doing so, it uses the same prejudiced structures, forms of argumentation and old anti-Jewish images as classic anti-Semitism and refrains from taking a differentiated view of economic and political structures.
## Secondary Antisemitism
Definition: In secondary anti-Semitism, a reversal of the perpetrator-victim relationship often takes effect, either attributing Jewish people with complicity in rejection and persecution or ascribing a perpetrator role to them. This also becomes clear in the insinuation that Jews would deliberately use the memory of the Holocaust to gain financial advantages or to immunize themselves from any criticism. Motives of a secondary anti-Semitic perpetrator-victim reversal are often also found in combination with motives of Israel-related anti-Semitism, for example in the form of inadmissible Nazi comparisons, one-sided accusations of guilt or accusations of an unlawful instrumentalization of the Holocaust.

#  Antigypsyism
Definition: Antigypsyism/anti-Roma discrimination is a manifestation of individual expressions and acts as well as institutional policies and practices of marginalization, exclusion, physical violence, devaluation of Roma cultures and lifestyles, and hate speech directed at Roma as well as other individuals and groups perceived, stigmatized, or persecuted during the Nazi era, and still today, as “Gypsies.” This leads to the treatment of Roma as an alleged alien group and associates them with a series of pejorative stereotypes and distorted images that represent a specific form of racism.
-	Distorting or denying persecution of Roma or the genocide of the Roma.
-	Glorifying the genocide of the Roma.
-	Inciting, justifying, and perpetrating violence against Roma communities, their property, and individual Roma.

-	Enacting policies without legal basis or establishing the conditions that allow for the arbitrary or discriminatory displacement of Roma communities and individuals.
-	Holding Roma collectively responsible for the real or perceived actions of individual members of Roma communities.
-	Spreading hate speech against Roma communities in whatever form, for example in media, including on the internet and on social networks.

According to consistent reports from those affected and social organizations, homeless people are exposed to a wide range of discrimination.

Hostility towards the homeless can be described as an expression of Social Darwinism.”

# Queer hostility
## Generally
Definition: Queerophobia is discrimination against queer people. It manifests itself, for example, through rejection, anger, intolerance, prejudice, discomfort or physical or psychological violence. However, queer hostility can also affect non-queer people who are perceived as queer or who (seem to) deviate from social rules and norms on sexuality and gender.
## Homophobia

The most frequent target of homophobia is male homosexuals, which is why the term is simplistically translated as homophobia.

Academics classify homophobia (as well as racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia) as an extreme right-wing "ideology of inequality".”

This means that classism is usually directed against people with low incomes, the unemployed and the homeless. Classism has an impact on life expectancy and limits access to housing, educational qualifications, healthcare, power, networks, participation, recognition and money.

# Hostility towards Refugees
Definition: Fundamental rejection of refugees as a group. Hostility towards refugees in general is a sum of pejorative attitudes based on the "ideology of inequality". Misanthropic prejudices against refugees characterise who "the foreigners" are. People are stigmatised as "different", "foreign" or "abnormal" based on their ascribed social group. In order to demean refugees as a group, people with anti-refugee attitudes spread untruths and deny facts. Targeted disinformation campaigns also play a central role here. The aim is to fuel people's fear of a supposed "foreign infiltration" caused by the influx of refugees.
